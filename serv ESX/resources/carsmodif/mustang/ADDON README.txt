In OpenIV navigate to \mods\update\update.rpf\common\data and extract dlclist.xml to your desktop. Open it with notepad and add the text below to the list of dlcpacks, save it and move it back where it came from. 
	<Item>dlcpacks:\2015wbpolstang\</Item>

Then navigate to \mods\update\x64\dlcpacks and create a new folder called 2015polstang and put my dlc.rpf into it.
