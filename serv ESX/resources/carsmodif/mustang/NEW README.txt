So basically what I've done here (again) is taken zQrba's 2015 Mustang Rocketbunny/Widebody, finished it, and transformed it into one bad ass marked/unmarked police car. After fixing a bunch of stuff (listed below) and adding a bunch, I've ended up with a slightly more complete version. This version is 99% bug free if installed properly. This version is by zQrba's description a Rocketbunny kit but IMO it looks more like a Liberty Walk kit so thats what Im calling it! I know the rims are horrible but no one will help me with some new ones so we are stuck with these til I figure it out! INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE AND IN README

BUGS 
---------------------------------
**If you have <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/ford-mustang-gt-rocketb-wide-body">ORIGINAL</a> model installed in place of dominator, not all tuning parts will work properly but some will. 
Windshield glass tints with the rest of windows?
Ram Bar stays attached in collision?
Please post pics of any other bugs you may encounter!

NOTES
---------------------------------
Light Smoke tint looks best
**For working tuning parts you need to install
	the <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/ford-mustang-gt-rocketb-wide-body">ORIGINAL</a> model properly as dominator

Installation
---------------------------------
In OpenIV navigate to \mods\update\update.rpf\common\data and extract dlclist.xml to your desktop. Open it with notepad and add the text below to the bottom of the list of dlcpacks, save it and put it back where it came from. 
	<Item>dlcpacks:\2015wbpolstang\</Item>

Then navigate to \mods\update\x64\dlcpacks and create a new folder called 2015wbpolstang and put my dlc.rpf into it. 

Use trainer to spawn by name: 2015wbpolstang

OPTIONAL - To use my custom siren pattern just place my carcols in \mods\update\update.rpf\x64\data but please note, my carcols affects all police cars that use siren1 pattern and I do have flashing headlights and taillights enabled!

P.S. I DO NOT GIVE ANYONE PERMISSION TO UPLOAD MY MOD TO ANY OTHER SITE!
